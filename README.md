# KanbanApp

See the live version of [KanbanApp](https://mikepatch.github.io/KanbanApp--React/build/).

KanbanApp is a project developed to practice modern React, including functional components, hooks, and context. It's an application for managing tasks using the Kanban methodology.

**Main features**:
- Adding new columns and tasks via a form (with form validation)
- Saving state using localStorage (we can refresh the page, close the browser etc. and our changes will be safe)
- Preventing adding a new task to an overflowing column (users are informed with a popup modal)
- Setting a limit for the total number of tasks in a column when adding a new column
- Managing columns:
    - Editing the color label of a column
    - Deleting columns
- Managing tasks: 
    - Moving tasks between columns
    - Deleting tasks

- Adding subtasks to tasks (TBD)
- Adding a modal to preview task details
- Implementing drag & drop functionality

## üí≠ Conclusions for future projects

I would like to improve...

#### State management
I want to deepen my knowledge of state management. Currently I'm learning Redux so my future projects will be much better in this matter :).
